        story:"People thought I was crazy to open a store. I had no business experience. I’d just gotten my PhD in chemistry. And there was a trade embargo with China, so there were no stores selling Chinese goods, even in Chinatown. But I was idealistic. I thought: ‘Maybe I can help connect our two countries. If I traded with China—just a little, maybe we would understand each other more.’ Technically it was smuggling. But the rules were very gray. And if you gave the Canadian border agent a little tip, nobody seemed to mind. I named the store ‘Pearl River,’ which is the biggest river in the Canton Province. I wanted to remind Chinese immigrants of their home. And I thought: ‘Nobody can hate a river.’ We stocked our shelves with products that many immigrants hadn’t seen for twenty years. These were products from their childhood: their favorite soy sauce, their favorite soap, their favorite tea. Word spread quickly in the community. Everything I put on the shelves was gone the next day. It was beginner’s luck. We were in the right place at the right time. This was the early seventies—the time of Vietnam. And American students were becoming anti-war, anti-establishment. I’d drive to the Harvard campus with boxes of Mao jackets and political posters, and all of them would be sold. The FBI interviewed me many times. They thought for sure I was a communist agent. They’d ask me: ‘Why else start a store like this?’ But I would tell them: ‘I just want people to learn more about China.’ Art is not the only way to understand other cultures. Business is major too. Maybe customer will pick up some tea off the shelf, and I will explain the history of tea in China. Or maybe customer will pick up this traditional cough medicine called Pei Pa Koa. It was invented hundreds of years ago. And it’s made of roots and loquat—a fruit only found in China. Maybe this will make the customer curious. Maybe they will leave with a question. And they will be inspired to learn more about China. This brings us closer together. And that’s why trade is such a big part of peace. Every product has a story. And every product is a chance for connection.",

        story:"I was more nervous than dreaming. I came to America with my mother in 1982. I had no English. No skills. And I didn’t know if I could survive. My first job was selling umbrellas on the street. One of my regular customers was the owner of this Army Navy store. He was an older man. So sometimes I would help him with his customers, just to give him a break. He liked me very much. He said: ‘Henry, come work for me.’ And right away he trusted me. He would let me handle the store by myself. And the customers loved me. They kept coming back, again and again. Our price was a very good price. But most important I think, was me: nice to people, always honest, treat customer like family. I was a very good worker. After seven years the owner says to me: ‘Henry, I’m old now. Please take the store.’ And he gives me the keys. Can you imagine? I was luckiest man. It was beyond dream come true. All of my customers were so happy. They say: ‘Henry, we want you to succeed.’ They come back again and again. Nothing makes me happier than a repeat customer. To see them walk in the door, you can’t imagine. I get so excited. When a customer leaves without saying anything, I feel nervous. Did I do something wrong? But a repeat customer means I did something right. I am OK. I am good at my job. Being a boss is the toughest job in the world. The worries, you can’t imagine. For so many months we were closed by the pandemic. Then when we opened again the city was like ghost town. No traffic. No tourists. On some days two or three hours would go by, and no customers at store. There are months when we sell $2,000, and the rent is $6,500. You can’t imagine. What am I supposed to do? My customers tell me: ‘Henry, we love you. We hope you survive.’ These words give me confidence to keep going. But how do you keep going? And what do you tell your family? I have three children. What do I tell them? Maybe I can drive uber. Or become a waiter. But what about my customers? I have customers who love me. Some of them I have not seen for a very long time. What if they come back and not find me here? And I never even said goodbye. Or thanked them. For all these years. For always coming back.",

        story:"When I left my home in Shan State, I only had 200 kyats, two packages of snacks and a water bottle with me. And with that, I set foot on Yangon city. For 3 days, I slept at random bus stops and was very hungry. I searched for jobs for weeks but most of them turned me down. That was until my sister led me to this job and things got a little better. On a side note, I love to sing. I actually do dream of becoming a singer one day.",
