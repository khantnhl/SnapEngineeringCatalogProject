        story:"People thought I was crazy to open a store. I had no business experience. I’d just gotten my PhD in chemistry. And there was a trade embargo with China, so there were no stores selling Chinese goods, even in Chinatown. But I was idealistic. I thought: ‘Maybe I can help connect our two countries. If I traded with China—just a little, maybe we would understand each other more.’ Technically it was smuggling. But the rules were very gray. And if you gave the Canadian border agent a little tip, nobody seemed to mind. I named the store ‘Pearl River,’ which is the biggest river in the Canton Province. I wanted to remind Chinese immigrants of their home. And I thought: ‘Nobody can hate a river.’ We stocked our shelves with products that many immigrants hadn’t seen for twenty years. These were products from their childhood: their favorite soy sauce, their favorite soap, their favorite tea. Word spread quickly in the community. Everything I put on the shelves was gone the next day. It was beginner’s luck. We were in the right place at the right time. This was the early seventies—the time of Vietnam. And American students were becoming anti-war, anti-establishment. I’d drive to the Harvard campus with boxes of Mao jackets and political posters, and all of them would be sold. The FBI interviewed me many times. They thought for sure I was a communist agent. They’d ask me: ‘Why else start a store like this?’ But I would tell them: ‘I just want people to learn more about China.’ Art is not the only way to understand other cultures. Business is major too. Maybe customer will pick up some tea off the shelf, and I will explain the history of tea in China. Or maybe customer will pick up this traditional cough medicine called Pei Pa Koa. It was invented hundreds of years ago. And it’s made of roots and loquat—a fruit only found in China. Maybe this will make the customer curious. Maybe they will leave with a question. And they will be inspired to learn more about China. This brings us closer together. And that’s why trade is such a big part of peace. Every product has a story. And every product is a chance for connection.",

        story:"I was more nervous than dreaming. I came to America with my mother in 1982. I had no English. No skills. And I didn’t know if I could survive. My first job was selling umbrellas on the street. One of my regular customers was the owner of this Army Navy store. He was an older man. So sometimes I would help him with his customers, just to give him a break. He liked me very much. He said: ‘Henry, come work for me.’ And right away he trusted me. He would let me handle the store by myself. And the customers loved me. They kept coming back, again and again. Our price was a very good price. But most important I think, was me: nice to people, always honest, treat customer like family. I was a very good worker. After seven years the owner says to me: ‘Henry, I’m old now. Please take the store.’ And he gives me the keys. Can you imagine? I was luckiest man. It was beyond dream come true. All of my customers were so happy. They say: ‘Henry, we want you to succeed.’ They come back again and again. Nothing makes me happier than a repeat customer. To see them walk in the door, you can’t imagine. I get so excited. When a customer leaves without saying anything, I feel nervous. Did I do something wrong? But a repeat customer means I did something right. I am OK. I am good at my job. Being a boss is the toughest job in the world. The worries, you can’t imagine. For so many months we were closed by the pandemic. Then when we opened again the city was like ghost town. No traffic. No tourists. On some days two or three hours would go by, and no customers at store. There are months when we sell $2,000, and the rent is $6,500. You can’t imagine. What am I supposed to do? My customers tell me: ‘Henry, we love you. We hope you survive.’ These words give me confidence to keep going. But how do you keep going? And what do you tell your family? I have three children. What do I tell them? Maybe I can drive uber. Or become a waiter. But what about my customers? I have customers who love me. Some of them I have not seen for a very long time. What if they come back and not find me here? And I never even said goodbye. Or thanked them. For all these years. For always coming back.",

For 3 days, I slept at random bus stops and was very hungry. I searched for jobs for weeks but most of them turned me down. That was until my sister led me to this job and things got a little better.

        story:"He was more than my brother; he was my best friend. I wanted to be him. He was more athletic, had more friends, got more girls. And things were going great for him. He was managing a pizza place. He had two kids, my nephews. But after he lost his job he started dealing drugs. He didn’t last two months in the streets. Benjamin thought the world was like our family; he was too trusting of people. And Detroit is a very dangerous place to be trusting of people. The Detroit Police Department did nothing: no leads, no investigation. It’s like he wasn’t even human. You can just murder people in that city. After his death I forgot about school. I dropped my classes, started drinking more, partying more. There was a lot of sex, a lot of meaningless sex. Nothing seemed to matter. It was dark. I was so angry at God, because how could he let that happen? But it’s been four years now. And looking back—if he hadn’t been killed, so many other things don’t happen. I’d have never left Detroit. Benjamin was the one who always told me: ‘You’re special. You don’t have to stay here.’ But if he hadn’t been killed, I’d have never come to New York. And if I don’t come to New York, I don’t meet my best friend, which is my wife. Our wedding brought my whole family together for the first time since Benjamin’s death. It was love and joy again. My mom walking me down the aisle, after losing her son. It just meant the world to her. And if I hadn’t met my wife, we wouldn’t have a son on the way. We’re naming him Benjamin.",

        story:"It’s going on seven years now. I was functioning until I lost my apartment, then my job. I was living with this one couple for a while but they kicked me out. But I try not to think about how long it’s been. I’ve read books about heroin addicts who changed their lives around twenty-six, so you know. I’m still young. I just want to get back to my life. I’m tired of waking up and needing it to not feel sick. I’m tired of being homeless. I want to start talking to my family again; that’s the biggest, I think. The not speaking to my parents. I missed my mom’s birthday. And my sister’s birthday; just two days ago. I really am blessed with a good family. I mean, my parents were strict; but I can’t blame that anymore. I’ve been trying to figure out the source of it. I think part of me just wanted to try everything. You know: what’s it like? But I think there was another part of me that wanted the attention, I guess. Something I could do so that people would like, ask me: are you ok? Some way to share the pain. I tried to kill myself once, when I was fourteen. I don’t know; I had such a good life. I was just so mad at myself for being so sad.",

        story:"Back in Myanmar my father was a farmer and he also went fishing. Along with my siblings, I used to attend school regularly. I was in Grade 2 when we left. We used to learn Burmese literature in school. But it all came to an end the day our house got burnt. The houses in our village were on fire. We couldn’t run to the jungle because it was on fire, too. We fled to another village but that village was also attacked. We were stranded so we fled again to a canal and stayed there for two days with no food. We made it across the border and now we live here in the camps,” Yacob explained. He continued: “I like being a leader. At the centre, I get the children together and them ask them to follow me when I am doing the actions. I tell them ‘Please, I am going to start reciting the poem, so follow me.’ I am a good boy and a quick learner. I also make other children laugh. It is fun. I want to learn more and more because I want to become a teacher when I grow up.\”\“They are slowly getting back to feeling normal again,” Noorkin said about her children. “I desire a bright future for my children where they can be what they want to be.\"",

        story:"When I was a little kid my mom left me, my younger sister, and my dad, because of our financial struggles. I felt so abandoned and unloved. And even though I was young, I had to start working to contribute to my family’s finances. My sister and I would forage for plants in the mountains and riversides. We carried the herbs, roots, and pinecones on our backs, walking for three hours to get to the marketplace. We sold our stuff so we could get corn powder to eat. And then we would walk the three hours back to our house. It was very, very hard. In my late teens my father passed away. I was devastated. After a few years of living with relatives, my sister and I moved back to live with our mom again. But we were still very poor. People would make fun of us for being so poor and not having a father around. I felt a lot of shame about my family and living situation. When I was 22, my mom asked me to start living with a man much older than me to lessen the financial burden on my family. I didn’t like living with him at all. I decided to leave my hometown to find a better life somewhere else. I walked for a few days to get to Hamhung, one of the biggest cities in North Korea, hoping I could find work there.Instead of going home, I started walking again. I just kept going north. Even though I was so hungry, the hope for a better life drove me to keep walking...After walking for days, I somehow arrived in Hyesan, a city on the border with China. I saw many people like me, who had been wandering around in search of food and work. I had travelled to many different parts of North Korea, and came to the conclusion that life was difficult everywhere in my country. A couple in their 30s or 40s approached me and asked how old I was. I told them my age, 23. They asked if I wanted to go to China. They said I could have a better life there. So I decided to go to China with them. I was so focused on having a better life; I didn’t ask many questions. A few days later, in the darkness of night, we crossed the river into China.",
